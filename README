Currently sqlite supports check constraints, but internally it just ANDs them
together into a single expression.  Thus, it cannot keep track of which
constraint failed.  These patches modify sqlite to keep track of the individual
check constraints and their names, and then include them in error messages.

Old behavior:

    sqlite> insert into mytable (a) values
       ...> ('some value that violates a check constraint named foo');
    SQL error

New behavior:

    sqlite> insert into mytable (a) values
       ...> ('some value that violates a check constraint named foo');
    SQL error: constraint failed: foo

If your check constraint is unnamed, then it gives you the expression:

    sqlite> insert into mytable (a) values
       ...> ('some value that violates an unnamed check constraint');
    SQL error: constraint failed: a in (1, 2, 3)

These additional constraint messages do make it up the chain into e.g. Python
exceptions.

Disclaimer: this code has not been tested to the high standard that the
official sqlite code seems to be.  But it "werks fer me" and I've use the code
for months on a website with moderate traffic.
